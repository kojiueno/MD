###Chapter 1
- Two values
      1. Use-value
      2. Exchange-value

- Use-value and Exchange-value are irrelevant
- Use-value comes from the usefulness of the object
- Whereas, exchange-value comes from the amount of labor required to produce it
- This is a big difference from the modern economics. In modern economics, the exchange-values are determined by consumers' preference

###Chapter 4   
- C-M-C
- M-C-M
- M-C-M' where M' = M + excess
- This excess of money is surplus-value
- M-C-M is the backbone of capitalism where capitalists pursue profts endlessly

###Chapter 6
- labor-power is a commodity like other many comoidties
- The profit is generated at the first circulation of the money (M->C)
- Capitalism is not natural, it stands upon the base of social structure
